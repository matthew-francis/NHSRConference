# Introduction to RMarkdown

R Markdown is really easy to use and can print to different document types such as word, excel, ppt etc

## Set a company template

This can be done as per the title parameters.


### This is level 3 in the header hierarchy

# Import data

Import and manipulate data.

```{r, readdata, echo=TRUE}

# READ IN SOME DATA TO PLAY WITH
patient<-read.csv("PatientData.csv")
```

Now we can do something with the data

How many records are there in the dataset?


```{r}
recs<-nrow(patient)
recs
```

There are `r recs` in the dataset.

What fields are in the dataset?

```{r, echo=TRUE }
df_names<-names(patient)

```

Let's calculate some useful information?
Let's calculate the mean weight, height and age

```{r, echo =TRUE}
library(dplyr)
# arrange - sorts the data
# select - selects required field names
# filter - exactly as Excel does it.
# mutate - creates a new field
# sumammarise

# select ID, Age, Height
pat_selection<- patient %>%
                  select(ID, Age, Height)

pat_filter<-patient%>%
                  filter(Age==15)

patient_2<-patient %>%
          mutate(wght_g=Weight*1000)

# m_wt is the mean of the weight.
# let's group the stats by Sex

summary_stats<-patient%>%
          group_by(Sex)%>%
          summarise(m_wt= round(mean(Weight),1), m_ht=mean(Height), m_age=mean(Age))

```



But this looks really messy. We can tidy it up with flextable.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(flextable)
tble_tidy<-flextable(summary_stats,
                  col_keys=c("m_age","m_ht","m_wt") )  
tble_tidy
```

# Insert a graph

Let's do a scatter graph of weight versus height.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

patient$Sex<-as.factor(patient$Sex)

p<-ggplot(patient, aes(Height, Weight,color=Sex))+
      geom_point()

p
```

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio#Packages

# Import an image

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)

# But the PNG package is loads better

include_graphics("logo.png")

```

1. This is the first in the numbered series  
2. This is the second  
10. This is the third   
This is some random text under the third bullet point  
4. Another point..... 

Enough of numbering - use bullet points:  

* use an asterisk

# Passing parameters into the document

This is a report I wrote out on a great trip to `r params$area`.

# Automate reports from the parameters

Lets say we are interested in `r params$age_t`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# pass from the parameters in the start of the document

patient_filter<-patient%>%
                  filter(Age==params$age_t)

```

# Working with table of contents

You can restrict the number of levels in the table of contents using toc_depth.
